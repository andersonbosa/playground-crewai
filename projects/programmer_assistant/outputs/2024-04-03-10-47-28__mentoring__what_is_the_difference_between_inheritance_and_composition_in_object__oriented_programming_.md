**Inheritance vs Composition in Object-Oriented Programming**

**Inheritance**

* **Definition:** A mechanism that allows a new class (child class) to inherit the properties and methods of an existing class (parent class).
* **Benefits:**
    * Code reusability and maintainability
    * Polymorphism (ability to treat objects of different classes as objects of a common superclass)
* **Disadvantages:**
    * Tight coupling between classes
    * Can lead to fragile code if the parent class changes
* **Real-world example:** A class representing a "Car" can inherit from a class representing a "Vehicle," gaining access to properties like "make" and "model."

**Composition**

* **Definition:** A mechanism that allows a class to contain instances of other classes as its members.
* **Benefits:**
    * Loose coupling between classes
    * More flexibility and extensibility
* **Disadvantages:**
    * Can lead to more complex code
    * May require more memory usage
* **Real-world example:** A class representing a "Car" can have a member variable of type "Engine," allowing it to access engine-related properties and methods.

**Key Differences**

* **Relationship:** Inheritance creates an "is-a" relationship (e.g., a Car is-a Vehicle), while composition creates a "has-a" relationship (e.g., a Car has-an Engine).
* **Coupling:** Inheritance leads to tight coupling, while composition promotes loose coupling.
* **Flexibility:** Composition offers more flexibility and extensibility than inheritance.

**Choosing Between Inheritance and Composition**

* **Use inheritance when:**
    * You want to create a new class that shares a common base with an existing class.
    * You want to enforce a strict hierarchy of classes.
* **Use composition when:**
    * You want to create a class that can contain instances of other classes.
    * You want to maintain loose coupling between classes.
    * You need more flexibility and extensibility.

**Actionable Recommendations**

* Consider the specific requirements of your application before choosing between inheritance and composition.
* Favor composition over inheritance when possible to promote loose coupling and flexibility.
* Use inheritance judiciously to avoid creating fragile code.
* Understand the benefits and limitations of both inheritance and composition to make informed decisions.
